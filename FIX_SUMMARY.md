# Website Blocker Extension - Complete Fix Summary

## All Issues Fixed ✅

### 1. Content Security Policy (CSP) Violations

**Problem**: Inline event handlers (`onclick`) violated CSP directives
**Solution**:

- ✅ Removed inline `onclick` handlers from `blocked.html` and `popup.js`
- ✅ Added proper event listeners in JavaScript using `addEventListener`
- ✅ Updated CSP to allow `'unsafe-inline'` for styles while keeping scripts secure

### 2. Chart.js Import Errors

**Problem**: Chart.js file contained ES6 imports incompatible with browser extensions
**Solution**:

- ✅ Replaced ES6 module version with UMD build from CDN
- ✅ Added error handling to check if Chart.js is loaded
- ✅ Wrapped Chart instantiation in try-catch for better error handling

### 3. Remove Website Functionality Missing

**Problem**: Remove buttons for blocked sites used inline onclick handlers (CSP violation)
**Solution**:

- ✅ Replaced inline onclick with proper event listeners
- ✅ Fixed CSP violations in the blocked sites list
- ✅ Remove functionality now works correctly

### 4. Blocked Attempts Graph Not Working

**Problem**: Visit tracking wasn't working properly, chart showed no data
**Solution**:

- ✅ Enhanced blocked attempt tracking in background script
- ✅ Added multiple tracking methods (onBeforeNavigate and onCompleted)
- ✅ Improved communication between blocked page and background script
- ✅ Added "Add Test Data" button for development/testing

### 5. Button Color Issues

**Problem**: Primary button text was invisible (white on white) due to RGBA transparency issues
**Solution**:

- ✅ Converted `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2)` grey to solid RGB equivalent `rgb(51, 51, 51)`
- ✅ Fixed button visibility on block page
- ✅ Maintained design consistency between primary and secondary buttons
